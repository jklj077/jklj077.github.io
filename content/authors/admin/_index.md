Xuancheng Ren is a graduate student in the School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science at Peking University, where he is advised by [Professor Xu Sun](http://xusun.org). He received the degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Peking University in 2017.

His research interests include natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning for NLP. Currently, he works on grounded language processing, which tries to incorporate various sources of knowledge (e.g., vision, commonsense, and semantics) into intelligent systems for reliable and explainable language processing. Previously, he had focused on techniques for efficient deep learning.
